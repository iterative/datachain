```

To specify a branch / revision:

```

Git URLs are also supported:

## Notes

* Closing the logs command (e.g., with Ctrl+C) will only stop displaying the logs but will not cancel the job execution
* To cancel a running job, use the `datachain job cancel` command
* The job will continue running in Studio even after you stop viewing the logs
* You can get the list of compute clusters using `datachain job clusters` command.
