## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/iterative/datachain/issues).

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

-   Which operating system and Python version are you using?
-   Which version of this project are you using?
-   What did you do?
-   What did you expect to see?
-   What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case, and/or
steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to request a feature

Request features on the [Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/iterative/datachain/issues).

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.8+ and the following tools:

-   [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/)

Install the package with development requirements:

``` console
$ pip install nox
```

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

``` console
$ nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

``` console
$ nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session. For example, invoke the unit
test suite like this:

``` console
$ nox --session=tests
```

Unit tests are located in the `tests` directory, and are written using
the [pytest](https://pytest.readthedocs.io/) testing framework.

## Build documentation

If you've made any changes to the documentation (including changes to
function signatures, class definitions, or docstrings that will appear
in the API documentation), make sure it builds successfully.

``` console
$ nox -s docs
```

In order to run this locally with hot reload on changes:

``` console
$ mkdocs serve
```

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request](https://github.com/iterative/datachain/pulls) to
submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

-   The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
-   Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
-   If your changes add functionality, update the documentation
    accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, though---we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks, you can invoke a `lint` session in nox:

``` console
$ nox -s lint
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate
your approach.
