If you don't see the GitHub App or repositories:

1. **Check Installation**: Verify the app is installed on the correct account/organization
2. **Repository Access**: Ensure the app has access to the desired repositories
3. **Permissions**: Verify you have admin access to the organization
4. **Cache**: Try logging out and back into DataChain Studio

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission errors:

1. **Review Permissions**: Check that all required permissions are granted
2. **Reinstall**: Try uninstalling and reinstalling the app
3. **Organization Approval**: Some organizations require admin approval for new apps

### Webhook Issues

If webhooks aren't triggering jobs:

1. **Check Webhook Settings**: Verify webhooks are configured in repository settings
2. **Event Types**: Ensure the correct event types are enabled
3. **Repository Access**: Confirm the app has access to the repository
4. **Network**: Check that GitHub can reach DataChain Studio servers

2. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and audit app permissions
3. **Organization Policies**: Follow your organization's security policies
4. **Access Monitoring**: Monitor app access logs and usage

### Permissions Audit

Regularly audit GitHub App permissions:
