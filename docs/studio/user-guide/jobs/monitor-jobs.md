### Job Status Indicators
- ðŸŸ¢ **COMPLETE**: Job finished successfully
- ðŸ”µ **RUNNING**: Job is currently executing
- ðŸŸ¡ **QUEUED**: Job is waiting to start
- ðŸŸ  **INIT**: Job is initializing
- ðŸ”´ **FAILED**: Job encountered an error
- âš« **CANCELED**: Job was stopped by user

## Real-time Monitoring

### Live Logs
View job logs in real-time as your job executes:

```bash
[2024-01-15 10:30:15] INFO: Starting DataChain job
[2024-01-15 10:30:16] INFO: Loading data from s3://my-bucket/data/
[2024-01-15 10:30:45] INFO: Processing 10,000 files
[2024-01-15 10:31:20] INFO: Completed batch 1/10
[2024-01-15 10:32:10] INFO: Completed batch 2/10
```

### Progress Tracking
Monitor job progress with:
- **Progress Bar**: Visual progress indicator

## Alerting and Notifications

### Email Notifications
Set up email alerts for:
- **Job Completion**: Notify when jobs finish
- **Job Failures**: Alert on job errors
- **Long Running Jobs**: Warn about jobs exceeding expected duration
- **Resource Limits**: Alert when approaching resource quotas

### Webhook Notifications
Configure webhooks for real-time notifications:
```json
{
    "action": "job_status",
    "job": {
        "id": "da59df47-d121-4eb6-aa76-dc452755544e",
        "status": "COMPLETE",
        "name": "data_processing.py",
        "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:15.000Z",
        "finished_at": "2024-01-15T11:45:30.000Z",
        "url": "https://studio.datachain.ai/team/my-team/jobs/da59df47-d121-4eb6-aa76-dc452755544e"
    }
}
```

### Slack Integration
Send job status updates to Slack channels:
- **Success Messages**: Celebrate job completions
- **Failure Alerts**: Immediate notification of job failures
- **Performance Reports**: Regular performance summaries

## Troubleshooting Jobs

### Common Issues

#### Job Stuck in QUEUED State
- **Check Resource Availability**: Verify if resources are available
- **Review Team Quotas**: Ensure you haven't exceeded limits
- **Check Dependencies**: Verify all dependencies are available

#### Job Fails During INIT
- **Environment Issues**: Check Python environment and dependencies
- **Git Access**: Verify repository access and branch availability
- **Configuration Errors**: Review job parameters and settings

#### Job Fails During Execution
- **Script Errors**: Check script syntax and logic errors
- **Data Access**: Verify input data availability and permissions
- **Resource Limits**: Check if job exceeded memory or storage limits

### Debugging Workflow

1. **Check Job Status**: Review the current status and error messages
2. **Examine Logs**: Look for error messages and stack traces
3. **Verify Configuration**: Ensure all parameters are correct
4. **Test Locally**: Run the script locally with sample data
5. **Check Resources**: Verify resource availability and limits
6. **Contact Support**: If issues persist, contact support with job ID
