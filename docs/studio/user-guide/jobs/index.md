# Jobs

DataChain Studio provides a comprehensive job management system for running data processing workflows in the cloud. Jobs allow you to execute DataChain scripts, monitor their progress, and manage computational resources efficiently.

## Key Features

- **[Create and Run](create-and-run.md)** - Submit and execute DataChain jobs
- **[Monitor Jobs](monitor-jobs.md)** - Track job progress, logs, and resource usage

## Job Types

DataChain Studio supports various types of data processing jobs:

### DataChain Processing Jobs
- **Data Transformation**: Transform and clean data using DataChain operations
- **ML Feature Engineering**: Extract features from unstructured data
- **Data Quality Checks**: Validate data integrity and quality
- **Batch Processing**: Process large datasets efficiently

### Scheduled Jobs
- **Recurring Tasks**: Schedule regular data processing workflows
- **Event-Driven Jobs**: Trigger jobs based on data availability or webhooks
- **Pipeline Jobs**: Chain multiple processing steps together

## Job Lifecycle

Understanding the job lifecycle helps you manage your data processing workflows effectively:

### 1. Job Creation
- Define job parameters and configuration
- Specify input data sources and output destinations
- Set resource requirements (CPU, memory, storage)

### 2. Job Submission
- Queue jobs for execution
- Validate configuration and dependencies
- Allocate computational resources

### 3. Job Execution
- Run DataChain processing code
- Stream logs and progress updates
- Handle errors and retries automatically

### 4. Job Completion
- Save results to specified destinations
- Generate job reports and metrics
- Clean up temporary resources

## Job States

Jobs in DataChain Studio can be in the following states:

- **CREATED**: Job has been created but not yet scheduled
- **SCHEDULED**: Job has been scheduled to run
- **QUEUED**: Job is waiting in the execution queue
- **INIT**: Job is initializing (starting up)
- **RUNNING**: Job is actively executing
- **COMPLETE**: Job completed successfully
- **FAILED**: Job failed with error
- **CANCELED**: Job was canceled by user
- **CANCELING**: Job is being canceled

## Resource Management

DataChain Studio provides flexible resource management:

### Compute Resources
- **CPU**: Configure CPU requirements for your jobs
- **Memory**: Specify memory allocation based on data size
- **GPU**: Access GPU resources for ML workloads
- **Storage**: Temporary and persistent storage options

### Clusters
- **Shared Clusters**: Use shared computational resources
- **Dedicated Clusters**: Deploy dedicated clusters for your team
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically scale resources based on demand

## Monitoring and Observability

Keep track of your jobs with comprehensive monitoring:

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Live Logs**: Stream job logs in real-time
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor job progress and ETA
- **Resource Usage**: Track CPU, memory, and storage utilization

### Historical Analysis
- **Job History**: Review past job executions
- **Performance Metrics**: Analyze job performance trends
- **Cost Analysis**: Track computational costs and optimize usage

## Best Practices

### Job Design
- **Modular Code**: Break complex workflows into smaller, manageable jobs
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and recovery
- **Resource Optimization**: Right-size resources to balance cost and performance
- **Testing**: Test jobs with sample data before full-scale execution

### Monitoring
- **Set Up Alerts**: Configure notifications for job failures or completion
- **Log Management**: Use structured logging for better debugging
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track job performance and optimize bottlenecks

### Collaboration
- **Shared Resources**: Use team resources efficiently
- **Documentation**: Document job configurations and dependencies
- **Version Control**: Keep job configurations in version control

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your environment**: Ensure your DataChain code is ready
2. **Create your first job**: Follow the [create and run guide](create-and-run.md)
3. **Monitor execution**: Use the [monitoring features](monitor-jobs.md)
4. **Optimize performance**: Review job metrics and optimize resource usage

## Next Steps

- Learn how to [create and run jobs](create-and-run.md)
- Explore [job monitoring capabilities](monitor-jobs.md)
- Set up [webhooks](../../webhooks.md) for job notifications
- Configure [team collaboration](../team-collaboration.md) for shared job management
