## Shared Resources

### Computational Resources

Teams can share computational resources for data processing jobs:

#### Resource Pools
- **Shared Clusters**: Teams can create shared Kubernetes clusters
- **Resource Quotas**: Set limits on CPU, memory, and GPU usage per team
- **Cost Management**: Track and allocate computational costs
- **Priority Queues**: Prioritize jobs from different team members

#### Configuration Example
```yaml
# Team resource configuration
team_resources:
  cpu_quota: 100           # Total CPU cores
  memory_quota: "400GB"    # Total memory
  gpu_quota: 8            # Total GPU count
  storage_quota: "1TB"    # Total storage
  
  job_limits:
    max_concurrent_jobs: 20
    max_job_duration: "24h"
    default_priority: "normal"
```

### Storage Resources

Teams can share storage resources and datasets:

#### Shared Datasets
- **Team Datasets**: Datasets accessible to all team members
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for dataset access
- **Version Control**: Shared versioning of datasets
- **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can contribute to datasets

#### Storage Configuration
```yaml
# Shared storage configuration
shared_storage:
  datasets_bucket: "s3://team-datasets/"
  artifacts_bucket: "s3://team-artifacts/"
  logs_bucket: "s3://team-logs/"
  
  access_policies:
    - role: "admin"
      permissions: ["read", "write", "delete"]
    - role: "member"  
      permissions: ["read", "write"]
    - role: "viewer"
      permissions: ["read"]
```

## Project Collaboration

### Shared Projects

Team members can collaborate on data processing projects:

#### Project Sharing
1. **Create Team Project**: Create projects within team workspace
2. **Set Permissions**: Configure who can view, edit, or manage projects
3. **Invite Collaborators**: Add specific team members to projects
4. **Track Contributions**: Monitor who made changes and when

#### Collaboration Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create a shared project
datachain project create --team my-team --name customer-segmentation

# 2. Add collaborators
datachain project add-collaborator --project customer-segmentation --user alice@company.com

# 3. Clone and work on project
git clone https://github.com/company/customer-segmentation
cd customer-segmentation

# 4. Submit jobs to shared infrastructure
datachain job run scripts/segment_customers.py --team my-team
```

### Code Collaboration

DataChain Studio integrates with Git workflows for code collaboration:

#### Git Integration
- **Branch Protection**: Protect main branches from direct commits
- **Pull Request Reviews**: Require code reviews before merging
- **Automated Testing**: Run tests on pull requests
- **Deployment Pipelines**: Automate deployment to different environments

#### Example Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-segmentation-algorithm

# 2. Develop and test locally
datachain run scripts/test_algorithm.py

# 3. Submit job for validation
datachain job run scripts/validate_algorithm.py --team my-team

# 4. Create pull request
gh pr create --title "Add new segmentation algorithm" --body "Description of changes"

# 5. Team review and merge
# Jobs automatically run on merged code
```

## Communication and Notifications
