@dataclass
class Checkpoint:
    """
    Represents a checkpoint within a job run.

    A checkpoint marks a successfully completed stage of execution. In the event
    of a failure, the job can resume from the most recent checkpoint rather than
    starting over from the beginning.

    Checkpoints can also be created in a "partial" mode, which indicates that the
    work at this stage was only partially completed. For example, if a failure
    occurs halfway through running a UDF, already computed results can still be
    saved, allowing the job to resume from that partially completed state on
    restart.
