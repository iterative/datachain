# Search Findings: "TRUSTED PARTNERS WITH GLOBAL INDUSTRY LEADERS" Text

## Search Results Summary

After conducting a comprehensive search through the datachain.ai repository, I was unable to locate the text "TRUSTED PARTNERS WITH GLOBAL INDUSTRY LEADERS" that you mentioned needing to replace with "Empowering thousands of users and customers from startups to Fortune 500 companies."

## Files and Locations Searched

### Main Page Files Examined:
- `docs/index.md` - Main documentation homepage
- `README.rst` - Repository readme file
- `docs/overrides/main.html` - MkDocs template override
- `mkdocs.yml` - Site configuration

### Search Methods Used:
1. **Exact text search** - Searched for the complete phrase
2. **Partial keyword searches** - Searched for "trusted partners", "industry leaders", "partners"
3. **Case-insensitive searches** - Covered various capitalization formats
4. **Semantic search** - Looked for marketing content and website text
5. **File structure exploration** - Examined all documentation directories

## Repository Structure Analysis

This appears to be a documentation repository using MkDocs for generating the docs.datachain.ai website. The main content files are:

- **Main homepage**: `docs/index.md` - Contains project description and features
- **Configuration**: `mkdocs.yml` - Site navigation and settings
- **Templates**: `docs/overrides/main.html` - Custom HTML overrides
- **Other pages**: Quick start, examples, guides, API reference

## Current Homepage Content

The current `docs/index.md` file contains:
- Project description: "DataChain is a Python-based AI-data warehouse..."
- Use cases and key features
- Documentation navigation
- Links to DataChain Studio and Open Source versions

## Possible Explanations

1. **Separate website repository**: The text might be on the main datachain.ai website (not the docs subdomain), which could be in a different repository.

2. **External content management**: The text might be stored in a CMS, database, or other external system not tracked in this repository.

3. **Different file format**: The text might be in a binary file, image, or other format not searched by text-based tools.

4. **Recent changes**: The text might have been recently removed or modified.

## Recommendations

1. **Verify location**: Confirm that the text is indeed supposed to be in this repository
2. **Check main website**: The text might be on the main datachain.ai website rather than the docs site
3. **Search other repositories**: Look in the main datachain.ai website repository if separate
4. **Add new content**: If the text should be added to this repository, I can help identify the best location

## Next Steps

If you can confirm where this text should be located or if you'd like me to add this content to the existing documentation, please let me know and I'll be happy to help implement the change.
