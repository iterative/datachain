How to set up your development environment
------------------------------------------

You need Python 3.8+ and the following tools:

- Nox_

Install the package with development requirements:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install nox

.. _Nox: https://nox.thea.codes/


How to test the project
-----------------------

Run the full test suite:

.. code:: console

   $ nox

List the available Nox sessions:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --list-sessions

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=tests

Unit tests are located in the ``tests`` directory,
and are written using the pytest_ testing framework.

.. _pytest: https://pytest.readthedocs.io/


Build documentation
-------------------

If you've made any changes to the documentation (including changes to function signatures,
class definitions, or docstrings that will appear in the API documentation),
make sure it builds successfully.

.. code:: console

   $ nox -s docs

In order to run this locally with hot reload on changes:

.. code:: console

   $ mkdocs serve


How to submit changes
---------------------

Open a `pull request`_ to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks, you can invoke a `lint` session in nox:

.. code:: console

   $ nox -s lint

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
