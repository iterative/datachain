"""
This is a simple UDF to demonstrate local parallel processing with multiprocessing.

In add_signals specify either parallel=-1 to use processes equal to the number
of CPUs/cores on your current machine, or parallel=N for N processes.
The default if parallel is not specified is to run single-threaded.

The UDF specified in map will then be run in parallel across all these
worker processes, no other code changes are needed.
